ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rohan Chhabra.
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m passionate about blending creativity and logic in web development, with hands-on experience in building real-time apps, from canteen management systems to multiplayer chess games.
ðŸŒ± Currently diving deeper into AI-driven solutions and enhancing my MERN stack skills.
ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on innovative projects that push the boundaries of tech, especially in real-time applications and AI integration.
ðŸ“« Reach me at rohanchhabra1906@gmail.com or LinkedIn.â€¨âš¡ Fun fact: When Iâ€™m not coding, I love editing travel videosâ€”itâ€™s like piecing together moments to tell a great story!
